Configuration page for TomHol's Pebble LCARS watch face

I love this great watch face and use it as my main one, but sadly, while setting up a new watch, I discovered the configuration page was no longer online.
I managed (with a great deal of luck) to retrieve the page from The WayBack Machine ([here it is](ttps://web.archive.org/web/20161209152638/http://pebbleconfig.php5.cz/lcars6.html)) and extract all the resources necessary.

The page is usable if you set up a web server with the files in this repository and set a DNS record named `pebbleconfig.php5.cz` to point to it.

I will try to make it work on the original domain for everyone to use and will update here if I succeed.
